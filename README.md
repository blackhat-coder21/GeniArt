# 🤖 GeniArt

GeniArt is a cool app that you can use on your Android phone. It's like magic – you type in words, and it creates pictures for you! The smart people who made GeniArt used a special tool called Android Studio with a programming language called Java.

But here's the really interesting part: GeniArt also uses something called the Stable Diffusion API key (https://stablediffusionapi.com/). This API key is like a secret code that lets GeniArt talk to the Stable Diffusion tool. Think of it as GeniArt asking Stable Diffusion for help in making awesome images based on the words you type.

So, when you use GeniArt, you're not just getting any pictures – you're getting unique and cool images thanks to the power of Stable Diffusion. It's like having a creative friend who understands your words and turns them into beautiful artwork! Just type, and let the magic happen.
